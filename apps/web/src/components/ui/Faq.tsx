      question: "What is PawBorrow?",
      answer:
        "PawBorrow is a platform that lets you spend time with pets without the long-term commitment of ownership. We manage and care for our own collection of animals, and you can book scheduled companionship sessions through our website.",
    },
    {
      question: "How is this different from adopting or fostering a pet?",
      answer:

        "PawBorrow currently operates in Quezon City, Philippines.",

      answer:
        "Browse available pets on the platform, check their profiles, and reserve a session for a time that works for you.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I choose which pet I spend time with?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Each pet has a profile you can view before booking, so you can pick based on breed, personality,or availability.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I cancel or reschedule a booking?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you can cancel or reschedule a booking through your account. Please check our cancellation policy for any fees or restrictions.",
    },
    {
      question: "What safety measures are in place during a session?",
      answer:
        "Sessions are scheduled and supervised to ensure both the pet's and the customer's safety, with scheduling designed to avoid overbooking or animal exhaustion.",
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have a problem during my session?",
      answer:
        "If you encounter any issues during your session, please contact our support team immediately through the app or website. We are here to help ensure a safe and enjoyable experience.",
